                After graduating from the University of North Texas with a BA in History with honors, 
                I enrolled in Syracuse University to learn programing. I obtained two certificates through
                 the College of Professional Studies at Syracuse University, Full Stack Development and Esports Gaming. <br><br>

                 I enjoy coding Websites and Web Applications. The building process is interesting to me due to just 
                 how much can be included on a website. I like seeing how a website comes together. <br><br>

                 Designing Banners and Logos for Twitch Streaming is something that I’ve done for my own channel on Twitch. 
                 Throughout the process, I was able to gain the skills needed to accomplish this goal through the guidance 
                 of a YouTube tutorial such as being able to use a photo editing software and a drawing tablet. <br><br>

                 I’m interested in creating Assets and Maps for Video Games. I made an unofficial map for a 
                 video game called City Skylines that I shared on the City Skylines Workshop. I enjoyed learning 
                 how the editor works and sculpting the map. This interest is one that is shared with my love 
                 for level design. <br><br>

                 Writing is something that I’ve been interested in for a while. There are a lot of different 
                 avenues even in the creative writing field such as quest and dialogues in video games.
